# Practical Work - Bluetooth

This repository contains the practical work of the discipline **Computer Networks 1**. The topic covered is **Bluetooth Technology**, covering its historical aspects, operation, technical characteristics and its main applications.

## Objective

This project aims to explore **Bluetooth** as a wireless communication technology, its evolution over the years, and how it applies to different areas of technology. The work describes its operation, from the physical layer to the application, in addition to demonstrating practical examples and everyday applications.

## Contents

The project is structured on a web page that describes the following topics in detail:

1. **Operational Description**: A complete explanation of how Bluetooth works, from the physical layer to the application layer, covering aspects such as signal modulation, link management, and the use of piconets.

2. **Physical Medium and IEEE Standardization**: Details on the operation of Bluetooth in the 2.4 GHz band and its standardization by IEEE (802.15), in addition to its coexistence with other technologies such as Wi-Fi.

3. **History and Evolution**: The evolution of Bluetooth from its first versions to the most recent advances, such as **Bluetooth 5.0** and the improvements of version **6.0**, which brings greater efficiency and reliability.

4. **Technical Characteristics**:
- Bandwidth and transmission rate.
- ACL and SCO connection modes.
- Frequency hopping technologies to avoid interference.

5. **Main Applications**:
- Audio connectivity (wireless headphones, speakers).
- Home automation and IoT.
- Mobile device and wearable connections.
- Automotive and object tracking applications.

6. **Practical Example**: Demonstration of how Bluetooth is used to pair devices, such as wireless headphones and smartphones.
